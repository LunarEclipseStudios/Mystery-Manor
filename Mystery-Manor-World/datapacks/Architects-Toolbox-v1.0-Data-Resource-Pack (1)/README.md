# Architect's Toolbox
## Resource/Data Pack for Minecraft: Java Edition

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-LGPL--3.0-orange)](https://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html)

[Note: Check branches to find resource/datapack]

This data/resourcepack is a smart tool used to make building with custom models easier!

:information_source: While Architect's Toolbox is technically a Fabric mod, it is technically a resource and data pack combined.
That is why it's source code is so bland and has no modding included; so no I am not keeping hidden code from you this is truly
all there is.
